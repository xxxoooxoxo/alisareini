I recently received a LinkedIn suggested prompt that got me thinking:

> You're juggling creativity and caution in your project. How can you avoid potential pitfalls?

From a software perspective, it is important to not migrate to the flashiest tools or technologies solely because they are modern or popular.

Use the right tool for the job, maintain good client expectations, and, as always, keep your people happy. Creativity will naturally find its way in!

I think this is a very simple way to view things; there's already too much complexity in software. Keep it simple.
